The purpose of this assignment was to create a calendar application that displayed the date and hours of the day.

Each block of time has a section where you can write in reminders or appointments.  The written text is then saved into the local storage which and will remain on the screen to be viewed, even after refreshing the page.

Calendar and reminder apps like this one are commonplace in today's world, and are incredibly useful for people in all professions.  jQuery is especially useful for these type of applications as it allows you to access local storage and utilize JavaScript functions without writing in JS.

This is a good assignment in which to become better acquainted with the syntax and application of jQuery and the helpful uses of local storage.
